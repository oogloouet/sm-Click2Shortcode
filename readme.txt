Click2Shortcode is a user friendly shortcodes plugin, it adds a button to your editor to allow you to add basic shortcodes like buttons and columns to your site.

You can add buttons, columns, videos, accordions, tabs and maps to your site by simply filling out a few options and clicking the Insert Shortcode button.

Please bear in mind that this will not work with every theme as some theme developers will overwrite styling, as such I cannot provide support if there are formatting issues with your site.
